* Hello and Welcome to the README from Anarchy! 
* This is a project that is being developed by me,
* Solomon Pattee, and is being developed for the purpose
* of creating a C++ application that can be run on the web.

This README is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses.

This tech stack consists of the following:

## Vite

Vite is a build tool that is used to build the project. It is used in this project to build the project.

## Stack

- Scala.js
- C++
- Koa.js
- Node.js

## Other Languages

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## REACT.js

React is a JavaScript library that is used to create the user interface. It is used in this project to create the user interface.

## Scala.js

Interoperability between Scala and JavaScript is done by using the `scalajs` package.

## C++

Loading the C++ code into the project is done by using the `node-gyp` package. This package is used to compile the C++ code into a `.node` file that can be loaded into the project. The `node-gyp` package is used in this project to compile the C++ code into a `.node` file that can be loaded into the project.

## Koa.js

Koa is the first spiritual successor to Express.js. It is a web framework that is used to create a server that can handle HTTP requests. It is used in this project to create a server that can handle HTTP requests and send back responses.

## Node.js

Node is a package manager and is also really awesome. It is used in this project to manage the dependencies of the Koa.js server.

## Libraries:

Akka
- Akka is a Scala library that allows for the creation of actors. Actors are objects that can send and receive messages. They are used in this project to allow for the creation of a simulation that can be run on a GPU.

Kokkos
- Kokkos is a C++ library that allows for the use of GPUs and other accelerators in C++ code. It is used in this project to allow for the use of GPUs in the C++ code that is used to run the simulation.

Koka lib
- Koka is a functional programming language that is used to create a library that can be used to create a simulation that can be run on a GPU.

Koha lib
A free and open source library

# Hierarchy of the project:

C++ will be the client's language of choice and the core.
 The server will be written in Scala.js and the client will be written in C++.
 The server will be responsible for handling HTTP requests and sending back responses. 
 The client will be responsible for handling the simulation and sending back the results of the simulation.
