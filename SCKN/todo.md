# TODO

## 1 Renders and Routes

## 2 Tech stack Connections
The Client has the React frontend and the Vite build tool. 
The Server has the Koa.js server and the Node.js package manager.

## 3 Tech stack Operations

## 4 CSS

## 5 Components

## 6 Library integrations

## 7 Builds and Deploys

Remember to change the localhost port to a link when the 
build and project is ready for deployment.

This thing will have 3 different deploys

1 for the client = maybe no builds 
1 for the server = one build
1 for the Frontend = one build

Client -> Server -> Frontend
1. Find a way to build the Client outside the frontend <- this is the hard part : find a build tool for the C++ side.

2. Run that client on the side outside the server <- : find a way to connect the client to the server.  

3. and the Server with the frontend <- this is the easy part :
use routes to connect the frontend to the server.
